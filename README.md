# Machine Learning Practice

This repository contains my practice work and implementations of various machine learning concepts and algorithms. The main focus is on understanding and implementing fundamental machine learning techniques using Python.

## Current Projects

### Iris Dataset Analysis
The repository includes multiple implementations and analyses using the famous Iris dataset:
- `iris_intro.py` - Introduction and basic handling of the Iris dataset
- `iris_digits.py` - Implementation focusing on digit classification
- `iris_measurment.py` - Analysis of Iris flower measurements

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Scikit-learn (for machine learning algorithms)
- NumPy/Pandas (for data manipulation)

## Getting Started
To run these examples, make sure you have Python installed along with the required libraries. You can install the necessary packages using pip:

```bash
pip install scikit-learn numpy pandas
```
